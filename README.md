# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

Problem Statement

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry 
professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the 
courses land on their website and browse for courses. The company markets its 
courses through different search engine like Google, through referrals, videos 
fill up the forms when browsing the courses etc. 

The analysis is done as a part of X Education to help them understand how can 
we classify different leads and convert them to make sure they are choosing 
the course. We use Logistic regression to give a Lead score between 0-100 for each lead and understand if the particular lead will be converted or not.
